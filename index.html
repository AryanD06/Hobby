        My favorite hobby is listening to music. I love soothing music. It helps me to remain relaxed and stress free.I listen music during my free time. I am 12 years old and I study in grade 7th. 
               Listening to music has lots of benefits. Scientists have found that music makes people happier,lowers  stress and depression, improves memory, helps to sleep better.Music strengthens learning and memory, raises IQ and academic performance and increases verbal intelligence.“Music is to the soul what words are to the mind.” – Modest Mouse
